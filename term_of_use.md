3. Rights We Grant You

Company grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services' benefits in a way that these Terms and our usage policies, such as our Community Guidelines, allow.

Therefore, you agree not to:

use the Service or any content contained in the Service for any commercial purposes without our written consent.

4. Rights You Grant Us

Many of our Services let you make calls, create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.

For all Services you grant Company a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.

Because Services are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to granting us the rights mentioned in the previous paragraph, you also grant us a perpetual license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it's necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post, or send content, you also grant Company and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your nickname, likeness, and voice. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Company or our business partners if your nickname, likeness, or voice is conveyed through Services, either on the "BabyAI" application or on one of our business partner's platforms.

For more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy.

We may record your conversations for safety and quality reasons, in particular to learn how you use the app and make your usage experience better.

While we're not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service

The Services may contain advertisements. In consideration for Company letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Services. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.

We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.

5. The Content of Others

Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although the Company reserves the right to review all content that appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.

Through these Terms and our Community Guidelines, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.

6. Privacy

Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that the Company can collect, use, and transfer your information consistent with that policy.

7. Respecting Other People's Rights

Company respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore may not upload, post, send, or store content that:

violates or infringes someone else's rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual-property right.

defames.

spams or solicits our users.

spam, solicit money from or defraud any users.

use another user’s account, share an account with another user, or maintain more than one account.

create another account if we have already terminated your account, unless you have our permission.

post any Content that violates or infringes anyone’s rights, including rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property or contract right.

You must also respect Company’s rights. These Terms do not grant you any right to:

use branding, logos, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials used in our Services.

copy, archive, download, upload, distribute, syndicate, broadcast, perform, display, make available, or otherwise use any portion of the Services or the content on the Services except as set forth in these Terms.

use the Services, any tools provided by the Services, or any content on the Services for any commercial purposes without our consent.

In short: You may not use the Services or the content on the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.

Other Users’ Content.

Although the Company reserves the right to review and remove Content that violates this Agreement, such Content is the sole responsibility of the user who posts it, and Company cannot always guarantee that all Content will comply with this Agreement. If you see Content on the Service that violates this Agreement, please report it within the Service or via babyai.app.sup@gmail.com.

Respecting Copyright

Company honors the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We therefore take reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become aware of. And if a Company becomes aware that one of its users has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable steps within our power to terminate the user's account.

We make it easy for you to report suspected copyright infringement. If you believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own or control, please contact us from babyai.app.sup@gmail.com.

Your notice must:

contain the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.

identify the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material.

provide your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.

provide a personal statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

provide a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.


Safety

We do our best to keep our Services secure and safe for all users. But we can't guarantee it. By using the Services, you agree that:

You will not use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited in these Terms.

You will not use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract other user's information.

You will not use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Services or other users' content or information without our written consent.

You will not use the Services in a way that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services.

You will not use or attempt to use another user's account, username, or password without their permission.

You will not solicit login credentials from another user.

You will not post content that contains pornography, graphic violence, threats, hate speech, or incitements to violence.

You will not upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Services.

You will not attempt to circumvent any content-filtering techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the Services that you are not authorized to access.

You will not probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Services or any system or network.

You will not encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms.

We also care about your safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never use our Services and drive. And never put yourself or others in harm's way just to post or talk on "BabyAI".

8. Payment

You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. "BabyAI" collects payments through a limited number of payment services (“Payment Provider”). You must provide "BabyAI" with valid account information for the respective chosen Payment Provider. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or other payment method, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities. By providing "BabyAI" with your payment information, you agree that "BabyAI" is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to "BabyAI" hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify "BabyAI" of any change in payment credentials for payment hereunder. "BabyAI" reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Website or by e-mail delivery to you.

9. Service Subscription Fees.

You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Services (each, a “Service Subscription Fee”) at the time you create your Account and select the term of your subscription (each, a “Service Commencement Dat”). Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the Services are non-refundable. No contract will exist between you and "BabyAI" for the Services until "BabyAI" or the Payment Provider, for example Apple or Google, accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of communication.

10. Taxes

"BabyAI"’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Service, or payments for any Service, are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to "BabyAI", you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority and you will indemnify "BabyAI" for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that "BabyAI" its permitted to pass to its customers that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

11. Automatic Renewal.

Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Terms. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at "BabyAI"’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least 24 hours prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going to the “Manage App Subscriptions” page in the Apple App Store or the “My Apps” page in the Google Play Store app. The same page will permit you to change your Account settings if you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription.If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then- current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize "BabyAI" to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if "BabyAI" does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that "BabyAI"  may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be re-activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).

12. Data Charges

You are responsible for any mobile data charges that you may incur for using our Services. If you're unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.

13. Third-Party Services

If you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with the third party), each party's terms will govern the respective party's relationship with you. Company is not responsible or liable for a third party's terms or actions taken under the third party's terms.

14. Indemnity

You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Company, our directors, officers, employees, and affiliates from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) your content; and (c) your breach of these Terms.

15. Disclaimers

We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.

IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY 'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID COMPANY, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.


SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

17. Exclusive Venue

To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Company agree that all claims and disputes, including statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the Turkey Courts of Istanbul.

18. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

19. Additional Terms for Specific Services

Given the breadth of our Services, we sometimes need to craft additional terms and conditions for specific Services. Those additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.

20. Final Terms

These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and Company, and supersede any prior agreements.

These Terms do not create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.

If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent.

These Terms were written in English and to the extent the translated version of these Terms conflict with the English version, the English version will control.
